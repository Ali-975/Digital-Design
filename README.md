# Digital Design by FPGADude
Hello, and welcome to my digital design repository. My name is David and I enjoy digital design using HDLs and FPGAs. I own 5 FPGAs: Basys 3 by Digilent with Artix-7 by Xilinx, CMOD A7 by Digilent with Artix-7 by Xilinx, Cora Z7 SoC board by Digilent with Zynq-7000-10 FPGA by Xilinx and dual ARM Cortex-A9 processors, DE2 by Terasic with Cyclone II by Altera, and the GO Board by nandland.com with Ice40 by Lattice. I do most of my FPGA projects and learning with the Basys 3 using Xilinx Vivado software.

This repository contains mostly Verilog code as it was the first HDL that I learned. I have stuck mostly to Verilog to begin with, and am now looking into SystemVerilog, and VHDL, as I want to have knowledge of all that encompasses the realm of digital design and FPGA engineering.

The Modules with Simulations directory contains individual Verilog modules with their test benches simulated in Xilinx Vivado.

The FPGA Projects directory contains Verilog projects implemented on the Basys 3 FPGA board. The Basys 3 FPGA board contains an Artix-7 FPGA from Xilinx, is made by Digilent, and can be viewed here https://digilent.com/shop/basys-3-artix-7-fpga-trainer-board-recommended-for-introductory-users/

The University Senior Class Design Project directory contains the Verilog files for the ASIC design of the project. See the README.txt file for information regarding the project.

The College Coursework directory contains my final projects for two courses: Digital Design II - traffic controller and Advanced Computer Architecture - microprocessor. There are also a couple of designs that were created for homework or lab assignments. These were the early days when I was first learning Verilog and simulating modules using Icarus Verilog and GTKWave from the command line.

The Learning VHDL directory is where I am putting all of my VHDL code as I learn and work with the language.

I have created and published an introductory tutorial book for Verilog which can be viewed here https://www.amazon.com/Verilog-Introductory-Follow-Along-Tutorial-ebook/dp/B09FR1BLCJ/ref=sr_1_3?crid=3NS3Y6786JH9J&dchild=1&keywords=verilog+tutorial&qid=1635800405&sprefix=verilog+tutoria%2Caps%2C178&sr=8-3 The Verilog Introductory Tutorial Book directory contains all the Verilog code from this book.

The 10 Verilog Projects Book directory contains all the Verilog code for my second Verilog tutorial book that is available here https://www.amazon.com/Digital-Design-Projects-using-Verilog-ebook/dp/B09MY1T9MB/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=verilog+projects&qid=1638841674&sr=8-1.

I am currently working on another Verilog tutorial book that is all about digital clocks. You can see two of the clocks, a binary clock and a 7-segment display clock, in the FPGA Projects directory. Other clocks in the book will include a VGA controller clock, 16x2 LCD clock, and 128x64 OLED display clock, all driven by the BASYS 3 FPGA board.

Thank you for visiting my repository.
