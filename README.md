# Digital-Design
Verilog HDL files

Hello, and welcome to my digital design repository. My name is David and I enjoy digital design using Verilog HDL and FPGAs.

This repository contains Verilog code for my design projects using Xilinx Vivado design software.

The Modules with Simulations directory contains individual Verilog modules with their test benches.

The FPGA Projects directory contains Verilog projects implemented on the Basys 3 FPGA board.

The University Senior Class Design Project directory contains the Verilog files for the ASIC design of the project.

The Basys 3 FPGA board is made by Digilent and can be viewed here https://digilent.com/shop/basys-3-artix-7-fpga-trainer-board-recommended-for-introductory-users/
